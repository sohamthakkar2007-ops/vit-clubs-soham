            The Social Welfare and Development Committee of Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune is a vibrant
            community dedicated to fostering sustainable social change. Embracing the motto “Help One Inspire Many,”
            we have embarked on a journey to create a more empathetic and inclusive society. Our volunteers,
            primarily students aged 18-22, are driven by a profound sense of duty and a commitment to making a
            positive impact. Through various activities and initiatives, we strive to cultivate empathy, leadership
            skills, and selflessness among our members, all while commemorating their efforts for a better world.

        <li><b>OBJECTIVE:- </b> Our objective is clear: to create an equal and just society where every individual,
            irrespective of background, has access to the resources and opportunities needed for a fulfilling life.
            We believe that even the smallest efforts, when combined, can lead to significant societal change.
            Upholding the values of empathy and gratitude, we provide students with a platform to give back to
            society. Our aim is to harness the enthusiasm, courage, and energy of youth towards meaningful causes,
            forming a community that advocates for inclusion and kindness. In this pursuit, our committee serves as
            a catalyst for positive change, working tirelessly to address social issues and uplift those in need. We
            strive to inspire others to join us in our mission, creating a ripple effect of compassion and goodwill.
